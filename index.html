    <h3>Samuel Martín</h3>
    <p>
        I’m Samuel Martín, a specialist in medtech training and education with over 15 years of industry experience. My goal with <em>The Medtech Training Lab </em> is to share expert insights, best practices, and innovative strategies that help medtech companies enhance their training programs. By improving the way healthcare professionals are trained, we can ultimately drive better patient outcomes. Through this podcast, I aim to lead the conversation on how cutting-edge training methods can shape the future of medtech and healthcare.
